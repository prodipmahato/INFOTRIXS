# INFOTRIXS🚀 Another milestone achieved in my internship journey with #Infotrixs! 🌟

I'm thrilled to share the successful completion of my weekly task - deploying a monolithic application. This hands-on experience was incredibly insightful and allowed me to explore various aspects of AWS and web development. 🌐

Here's a brief overview of my journey:

1. **Setting up EC2 Instance**: I deployed an EC2 instance (t2.micro) with Ubuntu as the operating system. It's amazing how a few clicks can bring a virtual machine to life!

2. **WordPress and MySQL on the Same EC2**: I configured the instance to host both WordPress and MySQL. It's all about efficiency and resource optimization!

3. **Security Groups**: Ensured the right security measures with two security groups - one for SSH and HTTP on the EC2 instance and another for RDS Aurora, with a custom rule linked to the EC2 group.

4. **LAMP Stack Setup**: Installed the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack to get the environment ready for WordPress.

5. **WordPress Installation**: Downloaded the latest WordPress package, moved it to the web server root, and unzipped it. WordPress, here we come!

6. **Configuring Apache2**: Made necessary changes in Apache2 configuration to set up the WordPress site.

7. **Welcome Page**: Created a captivating welcome page as the home of our WordPress site. First impressions matter!

I've attached a demo video to showcase the process step-by-step. Special thanks to my fantastic team at hashtag#Infotrixs who guided me throughout this exciting journey. 🙌

Looking forward to more challenges and growth! 💪 #InfotrixsInternship #InfotrixsTeam #AWS #cloud #LearningAndGrowing
